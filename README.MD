We've all been there. You wake up, check the weather for the day, plan your clothes and outfit accordingly and suddenly the weather doesn't match the prediction. Usually leaving you too hot or too cold. Or sometimes both. Weather prediction has gotten better as of late. Sameday forecasts are almost always accurate but the weather patterns beyond 3 days out seem to be unknowable. Now this is partially due to the fact that the weather is difficult to predict. Most models are non-deterministic and rely on assumptions of underlying distirbutions of error, additionally the Navier-Stokes equations haven't been solved and numeric simulations are incredibly costly (computationaly) further making the pipeline complicated. 

Google's Deepmind has had recent success use deep nerual-networks to predict weather. However even those are subject to long term errors and are only good for short-time within the same day predictions. Our goal here is to write a review of different (traditional) machine learning methods to predict weather and discuss the general difficulties of weather prediction.
